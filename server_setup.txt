GraphQL is a query language

When setting up your nodwe server, you need to clarify that you're using GQL.
You also need to set up the 'schema', which is what you pass to graphqlHTTP.
The schema file is where you write the code for how gql should behave.



/*

 -- EXPRESS SETUP --

const express = require('express');
const graphqlHTTP = require('express-graphql');
const schema = require('./schema/schema');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const cors = require('cors');


app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
    schema,
    graphiql: true
}));

*/
